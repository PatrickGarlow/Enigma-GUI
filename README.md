# Enigma_GUI
This is an encryption device with a user interface built in python

# Description
This is a recreation of the German Encryption machine from The second World War. I had already built this in Java only using the commandline for input, but as I was learning about User Interfaces I decided to make it again in python. I am using PyQt5 for this project

# Installation
To download this click the link below. It links to the "Enigma.exe" file as it was too large to put in the repository.

# Usage
Simply click and run the .exe file once it is downloaded. You can change what setting each gear is on and the input connections. Then you can either press the letter you want, as they did during the war, or below that you can encrypt whole sentences at a time!

# Video
Here is a video of me using the application!
